# Phone & Email Scraper
If you have the task of finding every phone number and email address in a long web page or document. If you manually scroll through the page, you might end up wasting a lot of time searching for them. What if you had a program that could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and email addresses.
## Starting Guide:

 - Press CTRL-A to select all the text
 - Press CTRL-C to copy it to the clipboard
 - And then run your program
 -  It replaces the text on the clipboard with just the phone numbers and email addresses it finds


## Installation Guide:

**Tech used:**  Python,  Regular Expressions Python

Download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, Then open your terminal/cmd or windows PowerShell then run this command `python3`, followed by the path to your script, You’ll need to make sure that your terminal’s working directory is the directory that contains your python script, or give the full path to the script `python run.py` .
