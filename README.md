# **Phone-and-Email-Scraper**

*If you have the task of finding every phone number and email address in a long web page or document. If you manually scroll through the page, you might end up wasting a lot of time searching for them. But if you had a program that could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and email addresses, you could simply :-*

**Press CTRL-A to select all the text** 
**Press CTRL-C to copy it to the clipboard**
**And then run your program**
**It could replace the text on the clipboard with just the phone numbers and email addresses it finds**

*This program uses Regular Expressions Python*
