# Phone-and-Email-Scraper
If you have the task of finding every phone number and email address in a long web page or document. If you manually scroll through the page, you might end up wasting a lot of time searching for them. But if you had a program that could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and email addresses, you could simply press CTRL-A to select all the text, press CTRL-C to copy it to the clipboard, and then run your program. It could replace the text on the clipboard with just the phone numbers and email addresses it finds.

This program uses Regular Expressions Python
